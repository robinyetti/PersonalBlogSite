This is a snippet of a Novel I had started. The story follows a young girl named Maebelle, who's apart of a whole story she doesn't even know yet. This is the story whereshe finds out.
___________
I woke with the sound of my dog's coo to the rising sun. I patted her happily on the head. Her tail brushed across the ground, lifting dust into the air, every speck dancing in a synchronized rhythm in the air.

I swung my sore legs over to the side of my cot, my feet dangling inches from the ground. I laughed.

*Just the way I've lived my life for 16 years now, floating just above the unresolved isolation and death.*

Today is going to be worse than most, and only very few knew why. Today, this morning, though warm and comforting, marked the day I cheated death. That's what most people say anyways. The real truth was that I should be dead, no joking matter.

There's always a pattern for this day: My Mom, Siege Halfmoon, will try her best to put it behind me, and will lie to herself that it will never happen again; while my step-dad, Stephen Bane, will always wonder what's wrong, because he wasn't there, and has been left in the shadows for the 5 years he's lived inside of *our* life. Then there was me, the only one who’ll be the true victim of the horror that happened only half a decade years ago. The tormenting feeling of knowing my true dad hated me so much, to the point where he pressed a knife to my neck. That *I'm* the only one who my father tried to kill.

I stared at my feet a while longer, then forced myself to get up and keep moving. My dog rushed to her feet with energy to power her and me both. I wished I could be as care free as her, to feel the simplicity of being happy.

Hazel must have noticed my distress, because she rested her head on my hip with wide, blue eyes staring up at me. Her eye brows lifted up into an arch in the middle to show her concern for her dear master. I only wished she could talk, maybe then I could truly open up to someone. *Who knows right?*

I turned into the hallway, Hazel next to me, and went next door to my bathroom. I looked into the mirror, ashamed to see the thin brown line on the side of my neck, hugging my curative artery. I shook my head, and gave my reflection a smile. I showed no signs of my pain, but I guess that's what happens when you have had practice for a while. I brushed my hair out; long, loose, messy curls get pushed back into a lazy ponytail on the back of my head, that sit comfortably in the center.

I walked out into the hallway, again, and met my parents at the end. I threw my happy, bright smile at them, the last thing I wanted them to do was worry, or even worse, know what I was thinking.

*Just smile.*

“Good morning Mae!” My step dad seemed in a chipper mood.

“Morning Darling.” Mom seemed loose, and halfway there. I knew it when I saw it. Mom started antidepressants again.

*Mom...*

I let Hazel out for her morning relief, and refilled her food and water bowl. This was my morning routine, the one I've followed for so long now. It's all but become a habit to me.

“Mae, are you okay?” Siege whispered into my ear. So she had remembered.

I nodded, “Well, I was thinking about running and catching a movie at Civilization Marketing, is that okay with you?”

Her eyes brightened with a spark, to my surprise. “You're going out?”

I nodded. Half lying.

“Yes, o my god, honey, this is a big step, since what happened... Don't let me stop you. Have fun!”

“Okay, Mom.”

I sat down patiently, having the breakfast served to me, like every day this oddly warm summer. My head turned to the open window seal, revealing the wide back yard, Hazel's sanctuary. I suddenly longed for that kind of environment. I wanted My Area. The only place I could be at peace. Where Tree's towered over me, and brush hid me from the world. That place where I could be alone. “Mae?”

“Yea?”

“Are you going to eat?”

“Yea.”

I chewed my food slowly, still trying to wake up. I still felt a little drowsy and out of place. The taste of sugary syrup covered my tongue, soaking into individual buds. The fluffy pancakes went down easier than normal. Maybe it was just because I wanted to eat my pain away.

“Mae?”

“Yea?”

“Don't you think you should start getting ready for your movie?”

“Um. . . yea, actually.”

*What am I sitting here for?*

I tripped over to my room. Shoved on my shorts, the brown cargos that ended four inches from my hips, and a blue tank top. I found my Father's old leather band, and tied it around my wrist, I sighed and brushed my fingertips across the engraved stars.

*The skies the limit, right?*

My face straightened as I stepped out of my room. I waved to my family as a walked outside. The sun was tiring. Despite my dark skin and love for the summer, I despised the heat the sun brought.

My Mom stepped outside, behind me, and threw her old baseball cap at me.

“Be careful Maebelle! Just because you're tan does not mean your invincible against those U.V. Rays!”

“I know, Mom. I love you.”

“I love you too, baby.”

I winked and turned East towards the Civilization Marketing.

*Click.*

I made a 180, and started to climb up Hell's Hill.
