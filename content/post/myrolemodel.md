My most influential teacher is Mr. Simoncini, who has shown me what a real, good hearted teacher really looks like. He has always been smiling, positive, and neutral. The air about him and his classroom always welcomed in me, like your grandparents home would when it's a nice fall visit. I never feel scared, intimidated, or repressed by him as a student, and it's wonderful that I feel like I'm learning through conversation, rather than lecture.

I know that he is a teacher, and it is hard to keep up with students, but he seems to remember everything about everyone; and everyone likes him for it. He knows when kids are upset, and even helps in the best way. He understand when kids have the rough days, and helps them generously in this class. I really respect how much honor and integrity he has to himself, and if you know anything about me, these are values with my high regard.

He was a strong man in the Military, and somehow did not come out completely brainwashed. He has somehow held to his morals, his beliefs, and his individuality when he came out from the Military. I'm not saying everyone who isn’t him is the same, it's that, there isn't a spot in his personality that shows me he was apart of what he was, or did what he did in there. He doesn’t allow people to change him, and he has a strong mind and soul for that. I really admire that in him.

He seems to understand, respect, and love everyone, no matter who they are or what they believe. I have never seen the man angry,nor have I ever seen him argue back. He is always calm and collected, which amazes me. I really wish I had his brain, I knew what he knew, and maybe understand just how easy it is for him to brush off the idiots, and still be kind to them. He’s also very optimistic, and I wish I had that in me too. The thing I'll never forget about him, was that he taught me how to have these qualities, and what it felt like to be on the other side of them. Mr. Simoncini was the first teacher in my life that looked at me as an equal. I may be a student, but I am a human being, and he values the little things in me, and helps me let them shine. I never felt more at peace, and more connected  as a student to teacher, as I have with Mr. Simoncini. And I’m sure I’m not the only one who does, and that’s why I’ll never forget him.
He isn't worth forgetting.
