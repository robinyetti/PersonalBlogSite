This is a snippet of a novel I had started. The story follows (yet another) female that suffers minor schizophrenia. Inspired from HBO's *Dexter*.

_____

Tonight, just like any other Friday night at any strip club, it was crawling with desperate creeps and hollow souls. I sat among them, lurking in the shadows, were the flashing red lights and booming music- if you could call it music- couldn't reach me. I stood just short of the lines of perverted men who craned to look at the overly- exposed women dancing provocatively around thick, gleaming metal poles, while I looked through small cracks and peep holes.

Another move.

Unlike most people here, I wasn't looking for some girl in a too tight, and too small strip of clothing to give me an erection. I wasn't here for that sort of pleasure. No, I wasn't here for my sexual tension, I was here for something completely, and utterly different.

He's the one.

Marcus Anthony slithered through the crowd of lonely, ugly, desperate men. I counted the seconds till I made my move too. I stood by for precisely 4.53 seconds, trying not to look to suspicious to the big, over-the-top muscular security guards at the entrance.

"Good night ma'am." The one to my right said in a monotone voice. His head slightly bobbed up to down in my direction. The ones in the club weren't the only ones desperate for a woman's attention.

I looked over my shoulder, through my shades, and nodded my head in a small salute.

I didn't delay my time any further then I had too. I walked up the street, checking my peripherals before I continued on. Nobody needed to see what I needed to do. Not tonight anyway.

Marcus Anthony made the major flaw of turning into a darkened alley. All of them did. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.

I hunched my shoulders, burring myself deeper into my leather jacket. You could never be too careful.

I was getting closer to him, the longer we walked down this alley.

Marcus made the sudden move of looking over his shoulder. I ducked under my ball cap, and slid to the nearest door. I focused in on the rusted doorknob underneath my cheek bones. I waited for two seconds before I cheeked my peripherals once again before I continued my stalk. We walked for too long, and this chase of mine was becoming just a burden.

I jumped him, making my move quick and sudden. Quick and sudden makes it quiet and deadly easy.

"Wha-"

"Save it for the kids, Darling."

My forearm was pressed tightly to his neck, I could feel his pulse underneath my skin. It wouldn't be too long before it stopped.

Marcus stopped struggling. I was getting closer.

I swung him around, wrapping his arm around my shoulders. I dragged him from the back of the alley to my silver Sedan. I threw him in the back, and zip tied his wrists and ankles together. It would make the struggle so much easier when he awoke.

I stepped into the drivers seat, and drove away from the curb in a hasty speed. The anxiety was starting to overwhelm me, and fill me up like fluid. I was so close, my need, my thirst was so close to being quenched that it stirred in the pit of my gut.

Just a few more miles. I told myself, but the anxiety screaming at me, and this damned car wouldn't move any faster. The road seemed endless in this big city. Whatever, not a problem. I thought of waited ahead of me. A nice, plastic wrapped room, a table, some knifes, and a tub of bleach. My palms itched beneath my leather gloves. No thanks to Dexter, a show on HBO, they made my job so much easier. the show came oddly close to the real phycology of my brain, but they got one major flaw wrong, people like me, because I know there is other people like me, I don't kill to fill a need, but to sooth the itch. It starts with anxiety, then comes the ache, the physical itch, then, finally, the voices come in. All it stems from the anxiety, always the anxiety.

My finger tapped the wheel, trying to pass the time, to calm the voices that started to surface.

Do it.

You have to.

You don't want to snap.

No she doesn't.

Not at school.

Shut up. I thought, I'm almost there. Just shut up.

the drive seemed more painful than most. Not even the repetitive ticking of my nails against the leather wheel couldn't ease the constant irritation.

I drove on.

Finally, I got my place.

Everything was ready.
