The Most beautiful place I have ever been is a special little place just past the fences of Knights Ferry. If you go across the bridge to the flat side of the river, walk down that path, go around the corner, up the hill, and climb past the rocks; if you make it over that weird grassy hill, you’ll find a face of a rock, that sort of resembles a dog laying down. If you walk up to this rock, and weave through the rough patch of terrain next to it, you’ll see a beautiful little almond tree sitting all by it’s lonesome.

That is my place.

It's small, and not very tall tree. It rests on the crook of the rock and the ground, and its little pink petals dance and fall into the wind. The wood is healthy and a vibrant red-brown color, and its branches sweep low to the soft and fuzzy grass below. It’s the most beautiful place to me, because when you sit under it, and face away from that rock, you can look out to see a gorgeous set of small hills and running water decorated with all sorts of rocks, trees speckled with little brown and blue birds, all framed around a peaceful entanglement of branches and blossoming flowers. If you're quiet enough, you can hear the soft hum of the bugs.

I could sit there for hours, and feel completely at home. I love this place.

I call the tree Grandma Tree, because it reminds me of the trees my Grandma had long long ago when she had The Ranch, and grew almonds and walnuts. That little extra piece of bittersweet melancholy only adds to the specialness of this place. When I first found it, I had turned the corner, and spotted this beautiful set of colors that contrasted so oddly and perfectly to the greens, grays, and browns that covered the world around it. The reds and the pinks of the blossoming Almond Tree was what caused me to sit under the tree, and see the most beautiful sight. I miss the place, since I’ve only been there once. But I remember it clearly and vividly. I can’t wait to visit Grandma Tree again.
