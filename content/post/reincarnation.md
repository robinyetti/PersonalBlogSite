Benjamin opened his eyes, a new being. You would wonder, what do you mean? Did he decide to become better person? Or did he wake up completely different?

The truth is, from a blindingly white dream, he woke up very different. His body felt smaller. He could see much farther than he originally could, and he smelt more in the crisp, clean air he once knew. He looked around, then down to his feet, and noticed something very wrong.

How did he know? He didn't know. He just KNEW.

Immediately, he thought of Cleoa, his wife.

He could see her smiling face under the glistening sunlight. The beautiful white rays warming her pale, beautifully aged face. Her green eyes just as bright as when they first met under the Ferris wheel all those summers ago. This made him happy, and get up to his feet.

He went to walk home. He went to get to her.

He found her under a white tent, looking down at the ground. She was wearing a new black dress, with a lace veil of a darker shade. As he came closer, he saw the tears that stained her rosy cheeks, and the life leave her eyes with each sob.

He noticed what she always did when she cried in public. She covered her mouth with her hand, and held her red streaked forearm close to her chest. As if she was holding on to a memory, *or maybe*, he thought, *the memory held on to her*.

She gazed down at a grey stone framed into the ground. On it, the engraving read : *Benjamin Oliver, Loving husband, finally at peace with his family.*

He looked back at his beautiful wife, as another sob came out. He could hear some sentence form, where her melodic voice expressed a sentence that meant dearly to her.

"I will wait for you, no matter how long."

He looked up to her, with a knowing gaze, and bowed his head.

*I am*, he thought, *I always will.*

She collected herself as he always knew she would. A few gasps of air, and a long heavy sigh. The sound of agony in her voice made him worry.

So he did what he said.

He stood next to her, even though she never knew.

A year went by, and he watched her laugh and smile, scream and cry, and live as she always did. Happily, with an apathy towards herself, and an immense empathy for everyone else.

All he wanted to do was hold her, kiss her, and whisper sweet words in her ear, like "it'll be okay," or "I love you."

But he had to love her from afar.

And he did.

He waited.

He watched her die in her sleep. And as heartbreaking as it was, he was still waiting.

And if one were to walk out to visit a deceased loved one, you would see him waiting, though you wouldn't actually know he was.

For all you would see is a red fox, with a longing gaze. Perched with melancholy on top of a gray stone that read:

*Here lies Benjamin and Cleoa Oliver. Together since 1933. May they be at peace with each other in the great beyond.*
