I am a person whose life story is more complex than the letter grades and course work in an application, or the lists of qualifications of a resume. I feel my existence would be incomplete without sharing more details 	about who I am. I have been told *over and over* throughout my life that I am mature for my age. The reason why is because at a young age, I learned the value of honesty integrity and compassion.

It really does start from the beginning. I grew up in a broken home. My parents fought bitterly with each other, and with ferocious intensity. What I saw as a young child, for many years, and even still today makes me stronger and wiser. School was always a struggle between escape from home life and the struggle to succeed *because* of home life. As I’m sure you can see from my accomplishments, some years have been better than others. There have been days where learning was the only way to run from the demons in my own head, and others have been nothing but focusing on getting through the session before breaking down. Because I saw and experienced the damage that dishonesty and manipulation can cause, trust and integrity have become central to who I am. With everything I do, those two values are present.

I have had the unpleasant benefit of learning from my parents’ mistakes. Their relationship has caused me to always look deeper to find the good in people. My whole life, the friends I’ve kept close to me aren’t *necessarily* what you would expect from an average kid. Everytime I see someone alone, someone who doesn't have anyone, whose eyes are too sullen for the age they're living, it makes me want to show them how kind and compassionate humans can be. I like showing people that there will always be someone who cares, even if they don't express it. Compassion has always been important to me because during my struggle with my own inner demons and hang-ups, it was the compassion of others that helped me through the darkest times. As I've climbed out of the dark pit I was sure I’d never get out of, I've learned to truly value the light that I’ve worked so hard to obtain. As I continue on the path toward my bright future, I’ll always remember the lessons I learned so early in life with the experiences I continue to have, and will never forget the value of honesty, integrity, and compassion.
