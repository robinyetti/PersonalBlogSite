This is a Novel I had started back in Junior High. The plot follows a Fallen Arc namede Autumn, and her Vigilantism to get her place back in God's Army.
______________________

“There was once a race of super beings called Arcs. Arcs had the power of nature and time. God created them to be his servants, like angels. Each of them, branded with a mark. The Mark of David. Their soul purpose in life was to serve God's every command, but one believed he was higher than *Him.* Lucifer became the first of the Fallen, and gained the unwonted title of Devil. Then others started to be rebel, following his evil; spies had recorded God's every move, every word. When God had finally realized he was being deceived, He Stripped them of their powers and Kasted them to the bottom pits of hell, even though it was to late. Then, their marks changed. Painfully, their marks turned black, and the gold, the heart of their body, dispersed into ashes. But what they didn't know, along with the gold, went their souls, and only with a power, so pure of white and gold, can they return to their position with God; Souls pieced back together. Yet, none found nor wanted the sweet fullness, and signed the Deal of the Devil. From the most evil of all they -”

“Enough!” Ms. Heathers snapped, “I mean, that's good, thank you.”

“A-okay.” Autumn sighed and returned to her chair, head held high, of course.

If only she knew.

Hayley, Annabelle, and Rockie all snickered at Autumn. It's not any of their business, she thought,*why can't they butt out?*

As Autumn quarried about the stuck up Porcelains whispering childish words about her, Ms. Heathers began her new speech. Just like every teacher, she expected the most out of her only advanced placement class.

“As you know, a tradition around this school is *The History of Poets Festival*. I would love to announce, we, as in you, my class, will become experts on your chosen poet. You shall have your own show on your own poets. I will assign you partners-” the bell rang “- Tomorrow! Pack up and have a good day!” she shouted, sighed, and gave up. Autumn threw her jean jacket on, and hoisted her bag above her shoulder.

“Its not whispering if everyone can hear you, just so you know.” Autumn attended to crack the plaster of the porcelain dolls standing amongst themselves.

“Go to hell, Autumn Cooper.” Haley Hayworth spat.

Autumn snickered, “Already have.”

Autumn turned the corner, and by the pillar, was October Miller, Autumn's only friend in the hellish place they called school. But this wasn't school, this was a place of gossip, a place of anger and rage. There was no learning here. The only thing even slightly close to learning was how to pick someone's pocket without them realizing who you were; but that is how it is in Los Angeles. Here, there's no respect, there's only lies and masks, hiding true souls. Here, the only bit of respect Autumn ever got was from October, who was from a small town in a large state with a redundant name of Wisconsin.

“Hows my significant other?” October said, inviting Autumn in for a hug. She walked into October's embrace, then quickly slid out. Autumn could feel the passion and the friendly love towards her, and had the fond memory slip away, like a small strand of angel hair after she stepped out. That was Autumn's punishment for joining the group of the Fallen. For leaving God's side, for leaving the position as the High Arc of Gospel 13, the highest of the Gospels, aside from the Specials. The Specials held the highest rank, and alone, held the power of Binding, to make one obey your every order, while Autumn held the power of a Shifter. Only plus side of being herself is that she can still Shift, and then, that's just because she has avoided the Devil's Contract.

“Hey, so there's a new kid coming, think he's going to be hot?” October asked.

“I don't know, I don't care.” Autumn replied. It was true, she never cared about men. She couldn't trust them either. She was broken because of her father. She never held a hand, never kissed, never hugged, let alone touch a man, because of him. What he did to her, she could never forget.

“You know his name, huh?” Autumn assumed. She new October was a man eater, from all the boyfriends she has gone through, Autumn would have never been able to do what she does. “Something like Justin, rumor has it that he's a lone wolf. So hot.” Autumn hummed her reply. Another broken heart, and another someone to avoid.

“What do you mean?”

“I don' know, just the girls from his old school say he's not social.” October explained. Autumn felt something lurch in her stomach, an instinct. She looked down at her feet, moving her along the ground. This instinct was unreadable. She sat down in October's car and continued to search for answers in her head. She was confused. Autumn reclined the chair and covered her eyes and let herself drown in the music. She listened to the drumbeat, the basses chords, and the vocalists haunting voice that seemed to carry in her ears. The words lingered in Autumn's memory.

*“You will remember me.

See my face and you'll see.

That you are my souls life.

Without you I would die.

I know you can save me."*

Grey swirls clouded Autumn's eye lids, twirling into an empty abyss. Autumn felt strangely content to the numbness this cool color brought her.

“Autumn, are you okay?”

Autumn shot up. The car was parked in the apartment's lot. She saw a pole with 105 spray painted to it. She was home.

“Autumn?” October questioned.

“I- I'm fine, I just fell asleep.” Autumn rubbed her eyes. How had she fallen asleep? Wasn't she just listening to the radio?

*Was it a dream?* Autumn wondered.

“You coming?” October asked. Autumn stepped out the car, and grabbed her bag.

“Yeah.” She said and walked to the apartment's gate, and unlocked it. She weaved through the planters in the plaza, walked up the stairs, and walked through the door way to their apartment. October followed. Autumn opened the door and smelt bread and jasmine. She set her bag down, and approached the kitchen counter.

Autumn wandered the kitchen, looking for something to chew on. She looked at the loaf of pumpkin bread she had made last night, and cut it into slices. She stacked them onto a plate, and set them on the table. October fiddled with the remote and patted the cushion next to her. Autumn glanced at October. October's red tinted, brown hair fell into loose curls around her shoulders, making her look pale and flawless. Her hazel eyes stared into Autumn.

“Sit down, and watch Princess Bride with me.” She demanded. Autumn sat and took a slice of pumpkin bread. The movie started.

He was stabbed, the main character. He fell to his death. Then, sudden flashes spun past her vision, of blood and a face Autumn knew very well. Her brothers death played like a movie in her own head.

The way the knife went across his throat, like a bow goes across the violin's strings. The way his face had a horror stricken look set upon it because he knew he would turn to ash, just seconds before he would hit the ground. He would again face God, not for another order, but for the path to where his resting place would be. And the worst part was that it was her fault. She went into a rage. She charged at the man, the Fallen. She crashed against him, like a wave into a rock. Force pushed him down. She positioned herself above him, the knife she held was in both hands, and plunged it into his heartless chest. She watched with pleasure as he burned and begged for mercy. “ I don't give mercy.” she spat, just before he bursted into nothing. Then she knelt by her brother's ashes, and mourned. She scooped his ashes and splayed it across her face. “Rest in peace, Jericho.” she managed to say in between sobs.

Autumn raced to the bathroom. She couldn’t hold her tears back. She slammed the door behind her, and burried her face in her hands.

“Autumn?”

She stifled a choke, “Go away.” she couldn't let October see her like this. Autumn was supposed to be strong. Always strong. Never weak.

The door opened a crack. October came in. Autumn was sitting on the toilet, covering her tears.

“Go. Away. Please.” Autumn pleaded. October came in, despite Autumn's desperate pleas, and patted her on the back. She took her arm and stood her up. Autumn looked away from her reflection, but October took her chin, and forced her to turn her bowed head.

Autumn had caramel brown hair, with blonde streaks that stood out, mocha colored skin that was somewhere between light and medium, and bright blue eyes, almost electric. She was what people would call beautiful, but she saw what nobody else did, which was hideous and soulless. October brushed her hair up and into a pony tail.

“Your mark is pretty, I wish I had one,” October whispered.

“No, you don't. What it used to be was Beautiful. This is vulgar.” Autumn replied, showing complete disgust. “It turned black because my Soul is. I Fell.”

“Why?” October asked.

“Because, what I did was wrong. God said.”

October gave her a confused look, daring her to tell the tale.

“. . . God called me in from my training, to give me a mission. My mission was to protect a Special while he was away on his *own* mission. I was to join my father's group in search for a Lost Soul, and I was to travel with the Special, and deliver his safely to the team. We were to leave immediately. It had been several days, and we were in the middle of Purgatory's barren Deserts, The Special was getting awful lonely, missing his wife at home. God, he would never stop talking about her, while I just kept directing the carriage. One night, I snapped I told him 'If you're that controlled by lust, you might as well find pleasure elsewhere.' So he did, lust got the better of him. He convinced my father that what he was doing was to break me, because I was a potential bad seed. He strapped me down and tore my clothes apart. The Special forced himself upon me. . . While my father just stood there, watching, as if he as watching nothing. . .  The Special took something from me that was dear,” another tear rolled down her cheek, “ then when he was done, he was the one to toss me from Heaven saying 'God doesn't need you.'”

Then the tear turned into a river of pure sadness.

“And your father?” October asked.

“I have no clue, for all I know, he's up there now, watching me. He's probably yelling at me about how disappointed he is as we speak.”

“But you didn’t do anything wrong.”

“That does not matter, it was still Sexual Sin, I wasn't married to the man.”

“So God is a jerk after all?”

“No, he did what was necessary, he sent me to Hell, then allowed me to suffer on Haven.” She sighed. The flashes of the Special's face as he moved with pleasure, as he forced himself upon Autumn. Flashes of Autumn's father, standing there, watching her, doing nothing, not caring. She shook the thoughts away. She turned to face October, “I'm going to head to bed.”

Autumn moved sluggishly to her room. She laid her head on her pillow, and felt it grow damp. She was crying. She felt the sorrow coming from her chest, radiating from her hollow chest, where her soul should be. She could faintly remember how it felt to have one. The memory was vaguely at the back of her mind, the sweet wholeness that every good being alive feels, barely hanging on by a thread. What she felt now, was a black pit. It was a gap that was cut into her, and emptied. Only she didn't know who holds the piece missing from her. She knew though, she wasn't going to stand around for it to come back like a cat. Thinking of gaining her wholeness back, Autumn drifted off to sleep, still clutching her chest.
