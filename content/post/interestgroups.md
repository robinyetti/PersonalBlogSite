Interest Groups take multiple actions to influence America’s many elections; There's many strategies and techniques that they practice to do so. The most popular form  is Lobbying. This is when a person, appropriately called a Lobbyist, attempts to directly influence people within legislation through interaction. This term first came from  time where private citizens gathered in the lobbies of political chambers and waited for the time to approach an individual official. Now, Lobbying has stretched past the actual Lobby and into press conferences, and even an official's private home. One other common technique is campaign assistance. The type of assistance can be one of a number of forms, usually donating money, volunteers, and endorsement are the most known. Unlike Lobbying, this form of influence is more accepted by political leaders. This is because endorsements can be powerful and can be used easily. Endorsements, from the right interest group, can go a long way into helping a candidate win or even retain their position(“Strategies”).

Interest groups often form groups called Iron Triangles to get a better grip on their influence on the government. Iron triangles, sometimes called subgovernments, usually consist of an interest group, members of congresional subcommittees, and bureaucrats. In this process, agencies and departments keep close contact with their interest groups’ Lobbyist. By doing so, the interest group can provide valuable statistics, and because they want their voice to be heard, both the interest group and bureaucrats value contact with the congressional subcommittees that govern their interests. With the three working together, they set most government policies(“The Bureaucracy”).

Interest groups also use Amicus Curiae briefs to help their influence. These are legal documents filed in appellate court cases by someone not directly engaged with a strong interest in the matter. Interest groups use these to issue the court of relevant information that they want the court members to consider before making a final decision. A good brief can hold a very significant impact of judicial decision making. Amicus Curiae briefs can even narrow or broaden holdings depending on the parties persuasiveness(“Amicus”).

While all of these techniques are very powerful and influential, interest groups deal with a great amount of limitations due to media and pluralism. Understandable, media has a lot of power over an interest group. Their actions must be taken very cautiously if they don't want media to turn against their plans and make them out to be the bad guy. This is simply because the average citizen relies on media for their opinion. Whichever is the more popular belief, people tend to follow, Pluralism, however, is a form of democracy. It’s  where each interest group is seen to have an opportunity to lobby government;, and express their point of view. The government takes into account, or listens to, the various conflicting, or opposing points of view, and then it makes a decision based on what it believes the majority would want, and it legislates accordingly As much as an interest group may Lobby, the final decision is made by the government. The government is in a mindset that it wants to please it’s people, and if the people are not in favor, the interest group is lost (“Chapter 9”).
