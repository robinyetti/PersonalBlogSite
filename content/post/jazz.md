Jazz holds a very precious part of the 1920’s. It’s idols and themes struck the hearts of many with their talent and spiritual verses.

Some of the very best artists of this time were Willy "The Lion" Smith, Jelly Roll Morton, and Louis Armstrong. Willy Smith was one of many who embodied the essentials of Jazz. He was always caught playing at parties and small clubs instead of recording studios, where he made his music career through talk of the party goers instead of radio broadcast. He created "Harlem stride style", which became a common way to play the piano. He spent his entire career battling for position as one of the greatest jazz pianists of the 1920’s.

Morton, on the other hand, is known as one of the greatest New Orleans Jazz composers. Much like rappers today, Morton invented stories to suit his stage character, and continuously added to the never ending list of rumors and speculations of his past. During his time, he founded and led the "Red Hot Peppers" while he was in Chicago, and began referring to himself as "the world's greatest hot tune writer."

While all this happened,  one of the Jazz’s most famous names was the great Louis Armstrong. Commonly mistaken for an astronaut, he was actually the first great soloist of the 1920s. Armstrong's popularity was due to the New Orleans style of Jazz. His influence was strong, and throughout the course of his long career he created a lasting mark on music.(10 Famous Musicians)

With the different types of performers in Jazz, there's also two different ways to play; there's lyrical, and non lyrical. Jazz commonly revolved around inner emotions like love, disappointment, despair, racism, happiness, depression, and desire for intimacy. With instrumental songs, this was achieved by using only a title to represent the sounds made with their instrument.Like in Duke Ellington's  "Black and Tan Fantasy",  the tune is a seductive tempo that harmoniously, though temporarily, brings two races of people together despite the segregation laws of the time. This plays into the emotion of love, and need for intimacy.(The Fundamentals of Jazz)

Jazz was a very controversial style of music. People who didn't understand it often rejected it and tied it with the kinds immoral behavior being seen in the 20’s. In addition, it did not help that the music started off in clubs where illegal alcohol was being drunk and people danced in risque manners. People also criticized it because they didn't think that such music could come from people of African-American heritage. On the other side though, many open minded people, such as flappers and adolescents of the time fell in love with  it because it was something different and new, and allowed them to escape the old traditions they wanted to leave behind. Along with this, Jazz also had inspiration for the new generation to build upon. Much like Jazz, the generation focused more on their emotions and their personal wants instead of religious practices. Jazz often sang about love and social equality, which lead many people to marry others where they held a large amount of intimacy and friendship, rather than economic reasons. It also allowed people to come to acceptance of the black society and see them as equals, as humans, rather than underlings that shared the same ground as us. (Musicians)
