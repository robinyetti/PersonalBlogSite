The Campbell Soup Company began in 1869 in a town right next to Philadelphia called Camden, New Jersey, USA. Originally called the Joseph A Campbell Preserve Company, they started making canned tomatoes and vegetables, along with various soups, jellies, condiments and minced meats. After a few years of hard work, in 1876, the company earned a medal for quality at the Centennial Exhibition (“Campbells”).

For 21 years after winning the medal, the company showed no major business breakthroughs until Arthur Dorrance, the general manager of the company in 1897,  hired his nephew, Dr. John T Dorrance. Dr. Dorrance agreed that in order to work for the Campbell Company, he would pay for his own lab equipment and get a salary of only $7.50 per week. In his time at the Campbell Company, he introduced condensed soup to the world, changing the soup business forever(Neilson).

Shortly after, The company won the Gold medallion for excellence at the Paris Exposition. This medal has been featured on all Campbell’s cans since.

Campbell's Soup now holds a $2.1 Billion brand name that extends past its original products. Now the company offers products like  Pepperidge Farm cookies, Goldfish crackers, Royal Dansk biscuits; V8 juices,  Bolthouse Farms super-premium beverages, Plum Organics premium organic baby food, Swanson broths, Prego pasta sauces, and Pace Mexican sauce(“Campbells”).

Currently, Campbell’s soup is sailing strong as one of the most purchased soup brands all over the world.  With annual sales of over $8 billion, it holds as a powerful brand in three “core categories”, Soup and simple meats, Snacks, and Healthy Beverages(Neilson). While under the workings of CEO Denise Morrison, they’re now focusing on making their signature soups and expanding into new categories, segments, and strengthen their core business further (“Campbells”).
