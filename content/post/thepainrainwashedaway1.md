A snippet of another Novel I had started. The story follows a girl named Rayne, who suffers extreme Body Dismorphia, and Masochism.

________
**Prolouge**

*Smack!*

Her body hit the dull pavement with a sickening sound. Immediately. she tried to push herself up. Her arms shook, trembled, and finally collapsed. She tried, gasped for breath, but she only coughed up more blood. The metallic taste coated her tongue as thick, hot liquid filled her mouth. A steel toed boot crashed into her side, just like from before, collapsing her rib cage in, piercing her lungs. A sharp breath stung her abdominal, like a thousand needles stuck into her right lung.

She lied there, listening to the boys snicker as they walked away from their bloody crime. They left her there, crying from the agony they brought her; but that was okay, she loved the pain. It was the only feeling that reminded her she was still alive.

She rolled over, lying flat on her back. Nothing felt better than the sweet burn of pain. Nothing could ever compare to how alive it made her feel. The only thing that kept her from becoming completely numb.

Now you know that girl lying on the ground, but you don't know who she is, or what her name is.

That girl, the one lying in a pool of her pain, the one covered in purple, green, and blue hues, her name is Rayne. She is me.
