What is the difference between drinking until you're more drunk than an Irish man on Saint Patrick's day, and smoking marijuana? What’s the difference between a woman wearing a man's sweater and a boy wearing a woman's shirt? What’s the difference between Gay representation and Straight representation in Government? What’s the difference between someone who feels pretty in revealing clothing, and a person who feels pretty in a Parka?

There ***isn’t.***

The double standards that are being construed in the events of trying to banish the old ones are only making society hate the other end of the group. People are saying were actually achieving equality and society is becoming accepting, but it really isn’t. Instead of accepting that we are no on the same boat as men, Feminists have decided that any man that tries to help a woman carry something is wrong and sexist. But if the man were to appreciate their “True Independence”, They would be hated on when they don’t offer to help when they *DO* struggle. Instead of hating the Homosexuals, no, we hate any straight male that gets a little awkward about it. We're just turning the tables on each other, and creating different double standards that just happen to support the other side. It’s like how we used to rag on people for drugs. Now as a teenager, if you don’t do any drugs, that including alcohol, you're a loser. If you wear the skirt too short, you're seeking for attention, and if it's too long, you're a prude. If you aren’t skinny and blonde, you're ugly; but you're supposed to accept yourself and call yourself beautiful. Were trying to get rid of “slut shaming”, but we shame women who find pride in modesty as we do it.

Alcohol is just as much of a drug as Marijuana. Clothes are clothes. Government has nothing to do with your sexuality or your gender. And your life is your life. Why do we even have “standards” as a society when were supposedly the free society? Why are we expected to accept everyone but those who don't accept everyone? This isn’t what America was supposed to be... America was supposed to be that one country where I can go, and say whatever I feel like saying, and anyone can disagree or agree or ignore as much as they want, and we still respect each other and live peacefully as a community. America is supposed to be that country where, it doesn't matter who we are, what our beliefs are, what our jobs are, we stand for each other, with each other, all as one.

But we aren't. Were the country with standards and expectations and lists of right and wrong morals and beliefs that spit fire and burn each other to the point where we don't stand as one.

It's a sad, sad truth.
