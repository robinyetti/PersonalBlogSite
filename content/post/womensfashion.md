It's all about *coordination* and *accessories*. In the 1920’s, women began wearing new and  beautiful outfits with hats, shoes, stockings, handbags, dresses and jewelry. Because many women wanted to get rid of bustles and corsets, they also  gave clothing designers much greater freedom, resulting in the new innovative styling.Dressing in new and colorful outfits became the new trendy fashion statement and many women jumped aboard nearly right away.

Unlike the previous generations, women began wearing dresses that were lighter, brighter and shorter than ever before. Designers took this opportunity to play with fabric colors, textures and patterns to create this new and popular type of dress. Because of this, shoes and stockings took a greater appearance since they were more visible. Ankle-strap cuban heeled shoes were the most popular heeled shoe during the decade.Simple brimmed hats worn low just above the eyes were worn on sunny days. Later in the decade, feathered headbands gained popularity in place of hats, particularly for evening attire when brimmed hats were not frequently worn. Large collar and oversized and floppy bows often adorned the dressy shirts.

To accompany the brand new hip look, large chested women decided to flatten their breasts and take attention away from their hips to give them the straight-lined figure that became the attractive trend.
Thanks to this generation of ambitious girls, we now have straight-up-and-down cut dresses that have a drop-waist, which is a 20s’ trademark, silk clothes colored in pastels that bring the ***ultra-feminine vibe*** and the pleated, straight cut skirts. Today's designers follow the 1920’s love to go crazy with details, with patterns like plaid and fringe, beaded designs and overboard sequins that give a “ distinctly 1920s sensibility.” With clothes like these, women today love to pair them with strappy shoes like sandals or T-strap pumps to complement their every outfit, and top them off with accessories like long and flashy necklaces, drop earrings, pearl, and things called metallic accessories.

Even over the years, as the looks of fabric and the hemlines changes in everyday society, the catwalks and red carpets will always follow their influence from the beautiful and glamourous 1920’s.
