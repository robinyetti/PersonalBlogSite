In my life, I have had many friends, and many, many acquaintances. No matter how close, and no matter how far, I chose to hold them close. My biggest sadness, and regret, is that the love and the care I showed for them wasn’t shown to everyone.

During my senior year, I had my “awakening” moment with God. I was going through a rough time, and I just wanted to go out and forget the hardships of being a highschooler all on your own for just a night, *at least*. I chose to go have dinner with my friend Christian Keys. We sat at Applebee's, where my (ironically so) Christian friend bought me dinner, and tipped the waitress a lovely amount. During my time there, I had witnessed acts of God. During that night, I realized that God really is Love, and He is real.

There’s a line that says, “Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love.” John 4:8. This is the very line that Christian read to me, and the line that made me realize I don’t know real love, and that is why I never fully felt or believed in Him.

My biggest sadness was that I didn’t realize this sooner, and my biggest regret was not learning what love really is. Since I have taken God into my heart, along with everyone else, my life has significantly been happier, and people in general are kinder. Regardless of what they may do with it, I always carry a giftcard around for the homeless, so that if one is struggling for a meal, he can get it. I try really hard to sit and talk to those who are alone, and especially at work, if someone is having a bad day, I try my best to cheer them up, even if all I get is a smile. Since I’ve chosen to understand real love, I’ve felt love.

My biggest regret is that it took me this long to realize what a real good person is.

>“Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.  It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in
>evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.”

My goal to counteract my sadness, is to do exactly this. Be patient, be kind, be humble, and be selfless. Do not get angry, and always forgive. Protect, trust, hope, and persevere. The fact that I haven’t learned this sooner is my biggest regret, because I need my Savior just as much as anyone else, and I haven’t done anything to deserve it. But God is love, and Love always forgives. I know that if I try to right this wrong, I will be okay, because I will be in His hands.
